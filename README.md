## Setup

Install the necessary dependencies to run the project locally using the node package manager of your choice:

```bash
npm install
```

## Develop

To start the development server, simply run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deploy

Simply run the following command and move the contents of `./dist/` to the root directory of your web server:
